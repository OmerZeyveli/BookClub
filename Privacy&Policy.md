Welcome to the Book Club App. This App is developed by Ömer Zeyveli, but it is administrated and moderated by **İyilik Derneği (“iyi-der”)**.

## 3. How We Collect Data
- **Directly From You**: When you sign up, you provide personal data such as your email, password, name, surname, university, department, and any preferences regarding book choices.

## 4. Why We Collect Data
- **Account Creation and Security**: We require your email and a password (stored securely as a salted hash) to create a user account and protect your access.  
- **Club Administration**: The personal information you provide (e.g., name, university, department) helps identify you as a member of the real-life book club.  
- **Book Distribution and Records**: iyi-der uses your book selection data to track which books you have chosen and to provide them to you in real life. This replaces a traditional pen-and-paper system and allows real-time monitoring of book selections.

- **Account Creation and Login**: Your email and hashed password are used to authenticate you in the App.  
- **Personalized Experience**: We display your chosen books and record your reading progress.  
- **Book Management**: iyi-der admins use the data to manage book distribution in real life (e.g., giving you the books you selected).

   - Our database is hosted on Amazon AWS DynamoDB, which stores your data securely in the cloud.  
2. **iyi-der Administrators**  
   - The administrators of iyi-der (2–3 authorized individuals, according to iyi-der’s statement) have access to the database to manage member data and oversee book transactions.

> **Important Note**: Ömer Zeyveli developed the App. However, Ömer Zeyveli is not responsible for how iyi-der uses or discloses the data beyond the App’s functionality. iyi-der manages the AWS DynamoDB account and decides who has database access.

## 7. How We Store and Protect Data
- **Cloud Storage**  
  - All data is stored securely in AWS DynamoDB.  
- **Password Security**  
  - Passwords are salted and hashed before storage to protect against unauthorized access.
